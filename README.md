# THFOOD-100 Thai Food Image Dataset
Dataset of Thai food images for the food recognition task

THFOOD-100 is a dataset of Thai food images for the food recognition task. It contains 53,459 images organized into 100 classes. Each image has a single label corresponding to the dish's name. The images were taken by users and manually labeled by domain experts. Only images of restaurant-prepared food are included, and stringent criteria are imposed to ensure high image quality and accurate labels.
